description: Conduct a five-axis code review — correctness, readability, architecture, security, performance
---

Invoke the agent-skills:code-review-and-quality skill.

Review the current changes (staged or recent commits) across all five axes:

1. **Correctness** — Does it match the spec? Edge cases handled? Tests adequate?
2. **Readability** — Clear names? Straightforward logic? Well-organized?
3. **Architecture** — Follows existing patterns? Clean boundaries? Right abstraction level?
4. **Security** — Input validated? Secrets safe? Auth checked? (Use security-and-hardening skill)
5. **Performance** — No N+1 queries? No unbounded ops? (Use performance-optimization skill)

Categorize findings as Critical, Important, or Suggestion, with specific `file:line` references and fix recommendations.

## Append to AUDIT.md

After the review, append findings to `memory/AUDIT.md` under a new `## Review — YYYY-MM-DD (HEAD: <short-sha>)` heading, grouped by severity. Do not overwrite previous reviews — append only. This file is the shared findings accumulator read by `/spec` and `/plan` when hardening work needs the audit as input.
